# What does Synthesis do?
It allows modders to develop mods via code rather than by hand.  These are often referred to as "patchers".

As a user creating a modded load order, Synthesis lets you add as many of these patcher mods as you like, and bundle them together into one single mod file: `Synthesis.esp`.  You should rerun the Synthesis pipeline any time you add/remove mods so the patchers can change and adapt to the new content.

# For Users:
Easily add patchers and run patcher pipelines on your game.
