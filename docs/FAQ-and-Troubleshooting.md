# FAQ and Troubleshooting

## Check out the Discussions tab
Rather than writing wiki articles about common questions and problems, the [Discussions](https://github.com/Mutagen-Modding/Synthesis/discussions) area is the place to look and ask!

It is a Stack Overflow style question and answer area that hopefully will serve the job better than static wiki pages.
