# Synthesis
A framework and GUI to empower people to create mods via code instead of by hand.  Users can run large numbers of these code-based mods and funnel their results into one or more files.

## Development
While Synthesis supports any external program as a patcher, it heavily facilitates creating and running Mutagen-based patchers.
Take a look at the [Development](https://mutagen-modding.github.io/Synthesis/devs/Create-a-Patcher/) side of the wiki, the [Mutagen](https://mutagen-modding.github.io/Mutagen/) documentation, or some [example patchers](https://github.com/Mutagen-Modding/Synthesis/network/dependents?package_id=UGFja2FnZS0xMzg1MjY1MjYz).
