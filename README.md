# Synthesis
A framework and GUI to empower people to create mods via code instead of by hand.  Users can run large numbers of these code-based mods and funnel their results into one or more files.

## Installation
If you're looking to install, we have a [wiki page](https://github.com/Mutagen-Modding/Synthesis/wiki/Installation) with the details.

Also be sure to head over to [Discord](https://discord.gg/53KMEsW) and ask any and all questions you may have!

## Development
While Synthesis supports any external program as a patcher, it heavily facilitates creating and running Mutagen-based patchers.
Take a look at the [Development](https://github.com/Mutagen-Modding/Synthesis/wiki/Create-a-Patcher) side of the wiki, the [Mutagen](https://github.com/Mutagen-Modding/Mutagen/wiki) documentation, or some [example patchers](https://github.com/Mutagen-Modding/Synthesis/network/dependents?package_id=UGFja2FnZS0xMzg1MjY1MjYz).
