# Starting Setup
If you used a Local [Solution Patcher](https://github.com/Mutagen-Modding/Synthesis/wiki/Local-Solution-%28Dev%29) to [[Create a Patcher]], then you will have a project that has a minimal basic setup:

```csharp
public static async Task<int> Main(string[] args)
{
    return await SynthesisPipeline.Instance
        .AddPatch<ISkyrimMod, ISkyrimModGetter>(RunPatch)
        .SetTypicalOpen(GameRelease.SkyrimSE, "YourPatcher.esp")
        .Run(args);
}

public static void RunPatch(IPatcherState<ISkyrimMod, ISkyrimModGetter> state)
{
    //Your code here!
}
```

# Run Patch Method
The RunPatch method is where the code for your patcher should be located.  It will be run when Synthesis is running a pipeline, as well as when your program is started standalone.  The method has access to the Synthesis State object, which has much of the information needed to run a patcher.  

Whatever changes you want to be made should be applied to the state's PatchMod object.

# Synthesis State Object
The state object given to your RunPatch contains several important objects:
- PatchMod: The export patch mod object that all changes should be applied to
- [LoadOrder](https://github.com/Mutagen-Modding/Mutagen/wiki/Load-Orders-and-Winning-Overrides):  Object containing all the readonly mod objects on the load order
- [LinkCache](https://github.com/Mutagen-Modding/Mutagen/wiki/LinkCache%3A-Record-Lookup):  Link Cache created from the load order
- ExtraSettingsDataPath:  Path where any custom [Internal Data](https://github.com/Mutagen-Modding/Synthesis/wiki/Internal-Data) will be located

# Typical Simple Code
Typical code for a Synthesis patcher consists of locating Winning Overrides for a record type, and adding them to the output patch mod with some changes.  Here is a simplistic example:

```csharp
// Loop over all the winning NPCs in the load order
foreach (var npcGetter in state.LoadOrder.PriorityOrder.Npc().WinningOverrides())
{
    // See if it is a Goblin 
    if (!npcGetter.EditorID?.Contains("Goblin", StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase) ?? true) continue;

    // Add it to the patch
    var npc = state.PatchMod.Npcs.GetOrAddAsOverride(npcGetter);

    // Shrink
    npc.Height /= 2;
}
```

The above code will shrink any Goblin-named NPCs

Two good resources for learning further details:
- A large catalogue of [existing patchers](https://github.com/Mutagen-Modding/Synthesis/network/dependents?package_id=UGFja2FnZS0xMzg1MjY1MjYz) to look at for examples
- In-depth Mutagen documentation found on the [Mutagen wiki](https://github.com/Mutagen-Modding/Mutagen/wiki).
