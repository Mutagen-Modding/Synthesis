Synthesis associates `*.synth` files with itself

# Installer Files
`.synth` files can be made to be "installer" files for patchers.  Users can double click a `.synth` file to have a patcher added to the currently selected group in the Synth UI.

## Using a .synth File to Install a Patcher
- Open Synthesis UI
- Click on the group you want the patcher added to
- Double click and open the `.synth` file
